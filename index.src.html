Abstract:
  This document provides a points to help in considering the privacy impact of
  a new feature or specification. The questions are meant to be useful when
  considering the security and privacy aspects of a new feature or
  specification. The respective points should be addressed by representatives
  (e.g. editors) behind the new proposal or a feature. Given the variety and
  nature of specifications, it is likely that the listed questions will not be
  comprehensive in a way enabling to reason about the full privacy impact.
  It is nonetheless the aim to present the questions as a useful point, helping
  to consider security and privacy at the start of work on a new feature.

  It is not meant as a "security checklist", nor does an editor or group’s use
  of this questionnaire obviate the editor or group’s responsibility to obtain
  "wide review" of a specification security and privacy properties before
  publication. Furthermore, the filled questionnaire should not be understood
  as security and privacy considerations, although part of the answers may be
  relevant in drafting the considerations.

<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  New web features are what makes the web live and stronger. When working on
  them - planning, drafting, implementing - there is always a risk of
  unforeseen security and privacy implications. This may happen due to the
  details of the new feature, some of its part(s), or the unforeseen
  interactions with other features.

  The challenges in standardization of web mechanisms are unique, as they
  relate to all the user agents. In that, the descriptions, protocols and
  algorithms need to be considered strictly, since the mechanisms are typically
  foreseen for a broad adoption by vendors with large user base. This unique
  position is a <em>challenge</em>, because inefficiencies and inadequacies
  introduced early in the process may propagate - eventually reaching to a
  number of User Agents, and affecting the security and privacy of users on a
  significant scale. However, this position is also an <em>asset</em>, since
  carefully considering the risks and challenges early in the process helps
  ensuring a high quality in terms of security and privacy.

  If a feature is found to introduce undesirable risks, weakness or threats,
  the risk does not only relate to the users and the browsers, but also to the
  web itself. This is because vendors may subsequently choose prioritising the
  protection of users by introducing changes breaking compatibility. In the
  end, the whole web ecosystem may be negatively affected.


  This is why each Working Group needs to consider <em>security and
  privacy</em> <b>by default</b>. This consideration is <b>mandatory</b>.
  Furthermore, assessing the impact of a mechanism on privacy should be done
  from the ground up, during each iteration of the specification. The
  questionnaire here presented is meant as guidelines helping to consider
  security and privacy as early as possible, on the level of Working Group (and
  earlier even, at the level of Community Groups).

  Providing adequate and informative answers to the questions, such as
  providing context, or explaining the reasoning behind certain choices, will
  also help in a wide security and privacy review performed later on, within
  the W3C review proces, and beyond.

  This document encourages early review by posing a number of questions that
  you as an individual reader/writer/contributor of a specification can ask —
  and that working groups and spec editors need to consider, prior asking for a
  more formal review. The intent is to highlight areas which have historically
  had interesting implications on a user’s security or privacy, and thereby to
  focus the editor, working group attention, and reviewers' attention on areas
  that might previously have been overlooked.</p>

  The audience of this document is general:

  *   The editors and contributors who are responsible for the development of
      the feature,
  *   The W3C TAG, who receive the questionnaire along with the request, and in
      line with the W3C Process,
  *   External audience (developers, designers, etc.) wanting to understand the
      possible security and privacy implications.

<h2 id="threats">How To Use The Questionnaire</h2>

  Starting to think about possible implications to security and privacy early
  in the project is the best approach. This approach helps providing the
  initial baseline  features are later checked against. Update the document
  (the security and privacy questionnaire) upon any significant changes to the
  specification. When requesting a Technical Architecture Group review, include
  the filled questionnaire, along with the description of changes or
  observations made during the design. This allows external reviewers
  understand the rationale, as well as thechallenges and evolution of the
  feature, with respect to security and privacy.

  It is understandable that developers may not always be have the necessary
  data to see the broader picture and possible implications, for example in
  relation to other existing web functionalities. The answers to the
  questionnaire are meant as help and input for people who may nonetheless make
  security and privacy remarks, or the assessment.

<!-- Big Text: Threats -->
<section>
  <h2 id="threats">Threat Models</h2>

  To consider security and privacy it is convenient to think in terms of threat
  models - in a way illuminating the possible risks.

  <h3 id="passive-network">Passive Network Attackers</h3>

  A <dfn>passive network attacker</dfn> has read-access to the bits going over
  the wire between users and the servers they're communicating with. She can't
  <em>modify</em> the bytes, but she can collect and analyze them.

  Due to the decentralized nature of the internet, and the general level of
  interest in user activity, it's reasonable to assume that practically every
  unencrypted bit that's bouncing around the network of proxies, routers, and
  servers you're using right now is being read by someone. It's equally likely
  that some of these attackers are doing their best to understand the encrypted
  bits as well (though that requires significantly more effort).

  *   The IETF's "Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack" document [[RFC7258]] is
      useful reading, outlining some of the impacts on privacy that this
      assumption entails.

  *   Governments aren't the only concern; your local coffee shop is likely to
      be gathering information on its customers, your ISP at home is likely to
      be doing the same.

  <h3 id="active-network">Active Network Attackers</h3>

  An <dfn>active network attacker</dfn> has both read- and write-access to the
  bits going over the wire between users and the servers they're communicating
  with. She can collect and analyze data, but also modify it in-flight,
  injecting and manipulating JavaScript and HTML at will. This is more common
  than you might expect, for both benign and malicious purposes:

  *   ISPs and caching proxies regularly cache and compress images before
      delivering them to users in an effort to reduce data usage. This can be
      especially useful for users on low-bandwidth, high-latency devices like
      phones.

  *   ISPs also regularly inject JavaScript [[COMCAST]] and other identifiers
      [[VERIZON]] for less benign purposes.

  *   If your ISP is willing to modify substantial amounts of traffic flowing
      through it for profit, it's difficult to believe that state-level
      attackers will remain passive.

  <h3 id="sop-violations">Same-Origin Policy Violations</h3>

  The <dfn>same-origin policy</dfn> is the cornerstone of security on the web;
  one origin should not have direct access to another origin's data (the policy
  is more formally defined in Section 3 of [[RFC6454]]). A corollary to this
  policy is that an origin should not have direct access to data that isn't
  associated with <em>any</em> origin: the contents of a user's hard drive,
  for instance. Various kinds of attacks bypass this protection in one way or
  another. For example:

  *   <dfn local-lt="XSS">Cross-site scripting attacks</dfn> involve an
      attacker tricking an origin into executing attacker-controlled code in
      the context of a target origin.

  *   <dfn local-lt="CSRF">Cross-site request forgery attacks</dfn> trick
      user agents into exerting a user's ambient authority on sites where
      they've logged in by submitting requests on their behalf.

  *   Data leakage occurs when bits of information are inadvertantly made
      available cross-origin, either explicitly via CORS headers [[CORS]],
      or implicitly, via side-channel attacks like [[TIMING]].
  *

  <h3 id="third-party-tracking">Third-Party Tracking</h3>

  Third-party tracking may occur when content from one origin is embedded or
  otherwise injected in another origin in a way that information may be
  accessed, revealed, queried or reasoned by third-party. This third-party may
  be a script injected on a first-party site

  *   The simplest example is injecting a link to a site that behaves
      differently under specific condition, for example based on the fact that
      user is or is not logged to the site. This may reveal that the user has
      an account on a site.

  <h3 id="legitimate-misuse">Legitimate Misuse</h3>

  Even when powerful features are made available to developers, it does not
  mean that all the uses should always be a good idea, or justified; in fact,
  data privacy regulations around the world may even put limits on certain uses
  of data. In the context of first party, a legitimate website is potentially
  able to interact with powerful features to learn about the user behavior or
  habits. For example:

  *   Tracking the user while browsing the website via mechanisms such as mouse
      move tracking

  *   Behavioral profiling of the user based on the usage patterns

  *   Accessing powerful features enabling to reason about the user system,
      himself or the user surrounding, such as a webcam, Web Bluetooth or
      sensors

  This point is admittedly different from others - and underlines that even if
  something may be possible, it does not mean it should always be done,
  including the need for considering a privacy impact assessment or even an
  ethical assessment. When designing a specification with security and privacy
  in mind, all both use and misuse cases should be in scope.


</section>

<!-- Big Text: Questions -->
<section>
  <h2 id="questions">Questions to Consider</h2>

  <h3 id="pii">
    How does the specification deal with personal information allowing to single out the user?
  </h3>

    Personal data are information relating to individuals. Singling out the user is possible when some unique
    information or traits are collected. For example, personal data allow singling out individuals on its own,
    or in combination with other information, to identify a specific person. The exact definition of what is
    considered PII varies around the world and is rapidly evolving, but may include, among the others,
    things like a home address, an email address, birthdates, usernames, fingerprints, biometric data,
    health information, but also identifiers such as cookies, identifiers, IP address, health status, preferences,
    affinities, beliefs, and much more, depending on the context.

    If the specification under consideration exposes personal data to the web,
    it’s important to consider ways to mitigate the impacts. For instance:

    *   A feature which uses biometric data (fingerprints or retina scans) should refuse to expose the raw data to the web, instead using the raw data only to unlock some origin-specific and ephemeral secret and transmitting that secret instead.
    *   Including a factor of user mediation should be considered, in order to ensure that no data is exposed without a user’s explicit choice (and hopefully understanding). One way to achieve this may be the use of Permission API [PERMISSIONS], or additional dialogs like in Payment Request API [PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]
    *   The users should be made aware if and when their private data may be exposed to the web

  If the specification deals with or introduces identifiers (persistent or not), the process should be documented,
   along with the nature of the identifier and its lifetime, whether it is limited to a particular origin or not.


  <h3 id="credentials">
    How does this specification deal with high-value data?
  </h3>

  Data which isn't <a>personally-identifiable</a> can still be quite valuable.
  Sign-in credentials (like username/password pairs, or OAuth refresh tokens)
  can be extrememly powerful in the wrong hands, as can financial instruments
  like credit card data. Making this data available to JavaScript, for instance,
  could expose it to <a>XSS</a> attacks and <a>active network attackers</a> who
  could inject code to read and exfiltrate the data. For instance:

  *   Credential Management [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT]] allows sites to request
      a user's credentials from a user agent's password manager in order to
      sign the user in quickly and easily. This opens the door for abuse, as
      a single XSS vulnerability could expose user data trivially to
      JavaScript. The Credential Managerment API mitigates
      the risk by offering the username and password as only an opaque
      <code>FormData</code> object which cannot be directly read by JavaScript
      and strongly suggests that authors use Content Security Policy [[CSP]] with
      resonable <code>connect-src</code> and <code>form-action</code> values to
      further mitigate the risk of exfiltration.

  <h3 id="persistent-origin-specific-state">
    Might this specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?
  </h3>

  For example:

  *   Service Worker [[SERVICE-WORKERS]] intercept all requests made by an
      origin, allowing sites to function perfectly even when offline. A
      maliciously-injected service worker, however, would be devastating (as
      documented in that spec's
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#security-considerations">security
      considerations section</a>). They mitigate the risks an <a>active network
      attacker</a> or <a>XSS</a> vulnerability present by requiring an
      encrypted and authenticated connection in order to register a service
      worker.

  *   Platform-specific DRM implementations might expose origin-specific
      information in order to help identify users and determine whether they
      ought to be granted access to a specific piece of media. These kinds of
      identifiers should be carefully evaluated to determine how abuse can be
      mitigated; identifiers which a user cannot easily change are very
      valuable from a tracking perspective, and protecting the identifiers from
      an active network attacker is an important concern.

  *   Cookies, <code>ETag</code>, <code>Last Modified</code>, <code>Local
      Storage</code>, <code>Indexed DB</code>, etc. all allow an origin to
      store information about a user, and retrieve it later, directly or
      indirectly. User agents mitigate the risk that these kinds of storage
      mechanisms will form a persistent identifier by offering users the
      ability to wipe out the data contained in these types of storage.

  *   Fingerprinting is a technique establishing a unique identifier based on the capabilities of specific
  feature alone (e.g. Canvas), or combining a number of features. Specifications and user agents should treat
  the risk of fingerprinting by carefully considering the surface of available information, and the relative
  differences between software and hardware stacks. Sometimes reducing fingerprintability may be revolve to
  specific operational considerations, for example providing information in same order (i.e. list of fonts),
  but sometimes this is not so simple.

  *   Some readout information that is subject to change may still act as a short-term identifier,
  and possibly introduce a risk of misuse (examples: <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/616">Leaking Battery</a>,
  <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/battery-status-not-included-assessing-privacy-in-w3c-web-standards/">Battery Status Not Included</a>).
  Good example may be the readout of ambient light level [AMBIENT-LIGHT], or battery [BATTERY-STATUS-API]


  <h3 id="persistent-identifiers">
    Does this specification expose persistent, cross-origin state to the web?
  </h3>

  For example:

  *   The <code>GL_RENDERER</code> string exposed by some WebGL implementations
      improves performance in some kinds of applications, but does so at the
      cost of adding persistent state to a user's fingerprint. These kinds of
      device-level details should be carefully weighed to ensure that the costs
      are outweighed by the benefits.

  *   The {{NavigatorPlugins}} list exposed via the DOM practically never
      changes for most users. Some user agents have taken steps to reduce the
      entropy introduced by
      <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=757726">disallowing
      direct enumeration of the plugin list</a>.

  *   The unexpected cases such as the one of [BATTERY-STATUS-API] when the battery level allowed to
      reason about the capacity as provided by the operating system


  <h3 id="other-data">
    Does this specification expose any other data to an origin that it doesn't
    currently have access to?
  </h3>

  As noted above in [[#sop-violations]], the <a>same-origin policy</a> is an
  important security barrier that new features need to carefully consider.
  If a specification exposes details about another origin's state, or allows
  POST or GET requests to be made to another origin, the consequences can be
  severe.

  *   Content Security Policy [[CSP]] unintentionally exposed redirect targets
      cross-origin by allowing one origin to infer details about another origin
      through violation reports (see [[HOMAKOV]]). The working group eventually
      mitigated the risk by reducing a policy's granularity after a redirect.

  *   Beacon [[BEACON]] allows an origin to send POST requests to an endpoint
      on another origin. They decided that this feature didn't add any new
      attack surface above and beyond what normal form submission entails, so
      no extra mitigation was necessary.

  <h3 id="string-to-script">
    Does this specification enable new script execution/loading mechanisms?
  </h3>

  * HTML Imports [[HTML-IMPORTS]] create a new script-loading mechanism, using
    <{link}> rather than <{script}>, which might be easy to overlook when
    evaluating an application's attack surface. The working group notes this
    risk, and ensured that they required reasonable interactions with Content
    Security Policy's <code>script-src</code> directive.

  * New string-to-script mechanism? (e.g. `eval()` or `setTimeout([string], ...)`)

  * What about style?

  <h3 id="location">Does this specification allow an origin access to a user's location?</h3>

  A user's location is highly-desirable information for a variety of use cases.
  It is also, understandably, information which many users are reluctant to
  share, as it can be both highly identifying, and potentially creepy. New
  features which make use of geolocation information, or which expose it to the
  web in new ways should carefully consider the ways in which the risks of
  unfettered access to a user's location could be mitigated. For instance:

  *   Geolocation information can serve many use cases at a much less granular
      precision than the user agent can offer. For instance, a resturaunt
      recommendation can be generated by asking for a user's city-level location
      rather than a position accurate to the centimeter.

  *   A recent Geofencing proposal [[GEOFENCING]] ties itself to service workers
      and therefore to encrypted and authenticated origins.

  <h3 id="sensors">Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user's device?</h3>

    Powerful features allowing to query information about the user system or environment may open new interesting
    use cases, as well as expanding risks and changing threat models.
    Examples of new feature of the kind may include sensors, communication channels such as Bluetooth or USB.

  <h3 id="local-device">Does this specification allow an origin access to aspects of a user's local computing environment?</h3>

    Features enabling to modify or query screen sizes or installed fonts may be useful but in some contexts might be introducing possible risks. Additionally, functionality facilitating access reason about the user computing environment such as by means of bluetooth or USB should be accounted for, whether the employed identifiers are long term or not.
  *   [AMBIENT-LIGHT] and [GENERIC-SENSORS] have an extensive discussion around the security and privacy risks


  <h3 id="remote-device">
    Does this specification allow an origin access to other devices?
  </h3>

  Accessing other devices, both via network connections and via
      direct connection to the user's machine (e.g. via Bluetooth,
      NFC, or USB), could expose vulnerabilities - some of
      these devices were not created with web connectivity in mind and may be inadequately
      hardened against malicious input, or with the use on the web.

  *   The Network Service Discovery API [[DISCOVERY]] recommends CORS preflights
      before granting access to a device, and requires user agents to involve
      the user with a permission request of some kind. The spec's
      <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/dap/raw-file/tip/discovery-api/Overview.html#security-and-privacy-considerations">Security
      and privacy considerations"</a> section has more details.

  *   Likewise, the Web Bluetooth [[BLUETOOTH]] has an extensive discussion of
      <a href="https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/#security-and-privacy-considerations">"Security
      and privacy considerations"</a>, which is worth reading as an example for
      similar work.

      Direct connections might be also
      be used to bypass security checks that other APIs would provide.  For example:

      * Attackers used the WebUSB API to access others sites' crendentials on a hardware security,
      bypassing same-origin checks in an early U2F API.  [[YUBIKEY-ATTACK]]

  <h3 id="native-ui">
    Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user
    agent's native UI?
  </h3>

  This concerns interaction with the UI, such as modification of browser display, or even such things as
  displaying a common pop-up with origin-controlled input, such as Notifications.

  <h3 id="temporary-id">Does this specification expose temporary identifiers to the web?</h3>

  Some identifiers may be difficult to pin-point  but they revolve around information that is stable in short-term manner (seconds, minutes, days) and may be available to web origins, whether in cross-origin manner or even cross-browser manner.

  *  [BATTERY-STATUS-API] is possibly the most unexpected example when battery may act as a short-term identifier (see also <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/616">Leaking Battery</a>, <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/battery-status-not-included-assessing-privacy-in-w3c-web-standards/">Battery Status Not Included</a>)
  *   Ambient Light readout may be perceived in a <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/privacy-of-ambient-light-sensors/">similar manner</a>
  *   Information such as ConnectionType, ConnectionType and rtt exposed by [NETWORK-INFORMATION-API]

  <h3 id="first-third-party">Does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?</h3>

  *   Section 2.1 of [[FIRST-PARTY-ONLY]] defines "first-party" in line with
      existing browser behavior (Chrome and Firefox).

  <h3 id="private-browsing">
    How does this specification work in the context of a user agent’s Private Browsing Modes mode?
  </h3>

  Some web features behave differently in private browsing modes (with respect to normal browsing modes).
  This is not always desirable. Features should work in such a way that the website would not be able to
  determine that the user was in a privacy browsing mode. This includes graceful degradation when a feature stops
  functioning in a way still not revealing the browsing mode. Some examples

  *   Ideally, the feature would work in such a way that the website would not
      be able to determine that the user was in private browsing mode.

  *   Less ideally, the feature wouldn't work, but the website still wouldn't
      be able to distinguish a private browsing context from simply being denied
      permission to use the feature (for instance).

  *   Unideally, the feature wouldn't exist at all in private browsing mode, which
      means that the user wouldn't be exposing data, but the website can probably
      tell that the user is in that state.

  Some examples:

  *  Non-standardised method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestFileSystem">requestFileSystem</a> enabling the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jherax/a81c8c132d09cc354a0e2cb911841ff1">detection</a> private browsing mode
  *  [PAYMENT-REQUEST-API] allowed the <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/privacy-of-web-request-api/">detection</a> of “incognito” mode


  <h3 id="storage">
    Does this specification persist data to a user's local device?
  </h3>
  User agents are able to store persistent data to user’s devices.
  The simplest examples are browsing history, cookies, or localStorage.

  *   How should user agent's "Clear browsing data" functionality work with
      this data? Are there caches that the user agent needs to be particularly
      careful with?

  <h3 id="considerations">
    Does this specification have a "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
    Considerations" section?
  </h3>

  Documenting the various concerns and potential abuses in "Security Considerations" and "Privacy Considerations"
  sections of a document is a good way to help implementers and web developers understand the risks that a feature
   presents, and to ensure that adequate mitigations are in place.
  I
  f it seems like a feature does not have security or privacy impacts,
  then say so inline in the spec section for that feature:

  <blockquote>
    There are no known security or privacy impacts of this feature.
  </blockquote>

  Saying so explicitly in the specification serves several purposes:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Shows that a spec author/editor has explicitly considered security and
      privacy when designing a feature.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provides some sense of confidence that there might be no such impacts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Challenges security and privacy minded individuals to think of and find
      even the potential for such impacts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrates the spec author/editor's receptivity to feedback about such
      impacts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrates a desire that the specification should not be introducing security and privacy issues
    </li>
  </ol>

  When saying this, however, the crucial aspect is to actually considering security and privacy.
  All new specifications must have security and privacy considerations sections to be considered
  for wide reviews. Interesting features added to the web platform generally often already had security
  and/or privacy impacts.

  <h3 id="relaxed-sop">
    Does this specification allow downgrading default security characteristics?
  </h3>

  *   <code>document.domain</code>
  *   [[CORS]]
  *   [[WEBMESSAGING]]
  *   <code>referrer 'unsafe-always'</code>

  <h3 id="behavioral-monitoring">
    Does this specification allow the persistent monitoring of user behavior?
  </h3>
    Users on the web can be monitored in variaty of means, for example using access to sensors potentially
    providing mobility patterns (e.g. accelerator, light sensor, web bluetooth), or directly on the web such as
    the monitoring of mouse movement, which are biometric data conveying rich information.

<section>
  <h2 id="mitigations">
    Mitigation Strategies
  </h2>

  <h3 id="secure-contexts">
    Secure Contexts
  </h3>

  In the presence of an <a>active network attacker</a>, offering a feature to
  an insecure origin is the same as offering that feature to every origin (as
  the attacker can inject frames and code at will). Requiring an encrypted and
  authenticated connection in order to use a feature can mitigate this kind of
  risk.

  <h3 id="user-mediation">
    Explicit user mediation
  </h3>

  If a feature has privacy or security impacts that are endemic to the feature
  itself, then one valid strategy for exposing it to the web is to require user
  mediation before granting an origin access. For instance, [[GEOLOCATION-API]]
  reveals a user's location, and wouldn't be particularly useful if it didn't;
  user agents generally gate access to the feature on a permission prompt which
  the user may choose to accept.

  Designing such prompts is difficult. Choosers are good. Walls of text are bad.

  ISSUE: Bring in some of felt@'s ideas here.

  <h3 id="drop-feature">
    Drop the feature
  </h3>

    The simplest way to mitigate potential negative security or privacy impacts of a feature,
    and even discussing the possibility, is to drop the feature.
    Every feature in a spec should be considered guilty (of harming security and/or privacy) until proven otherwise.

    Every specification should seek to be as small as possible, even if only for the reasons of reducing
    and minimizing security/privacy attack surface(s).

    By doing so we can reduce the overall security (and privacy) attack surface of not only a particular feature,
    but of a module (related set of features), a specification, and the overall web platform.

        Sanitize the data handled in the feature
      </h3>

      It is always a good strategy to consider the kinds of data a new feature is processing. For example, new features allowing the readout of data may want to adopt specific privacy strategies such as minimizing the quality of datas (quantization) or reducing the frequency, in line with standard privacy engineering practices. Examples
      *   [BATTERY-STATUS-API] <em>“The user agent should not expose high precision readouts”</em>
      * [SENSORS-API] <em>“Limit maximum sampling frequency”, “Reduce accuracy”</em>


      <h3 id="user-mediation">
        Making a privacy impact assessment
      </h3>

      Some features are potentially supplying very sensitive data, and it is the end-developer,
      system owners, or managers responsibility to realize this and act accordingly in the design of his/her
      system. Some use may warrant conducting as privacy impact assessment, especially when data relating to
      individuals may be processed. Examples.

  <h2 id="howtouse">How to Use the questionnaire</h2>

  To ensure good designs, security and privacy should be considered as early as possible.
  This questionnaire facilitates this and the questions should be considered early in the specification development
  process, kept in mind as it matures, with the answers being updated along the specification evolution.
  This questionnaire should not be used as a “check box" excercise before requesting final publication - acting in
  this manner does not help improve privacy or security on the Web.  Each question needs to be considered and that
  any privacy or security concerns are described, along with a possible mitigation strategy.
  It is not a good approach to provide a one-word answer (“yes” / “no”). Rather, it is expected to include an
  explanatory description. The questions in the questionnaire are more about “why” and “how”, rather than “if”.

  It is expected that a questionnaire must be filled in prior to obtaining a W3C Working Draft status, and prior to requiring a review, along the Privacy by Design principles.
  The questionnaire and its answers should not be included in the specification itself. It is preferable to keep it in a standard and easily available place, with a link available in the TAG repository.
